/**
  * Created by Iryna Kharaborkina on 8/9/16. 
  *
  * Solution to the Chapter 13 Exercise 07 'Scala for the Impatient' by Horstmann C.S.
  *
  * The expression
  *     (prices zip quantities) map { p => p._1 * p._2 }
  * is a bit inelegant.
  * We canâ€™t do (prices zip quantities) map { _ * _ } because _ * _ is a function with two arguments,
  * and we need a function with one argument that is a tuple. The tupled method of the Function2 object
  * changes a function with two arguments to one that takes a tuple.
  * Apply tupled to the multiplication function so you can map it over the list of pairs.
