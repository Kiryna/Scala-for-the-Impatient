/**
  * Created by Iryna Kharaborkina on 8/11/16. 
  *
  * Solution to the Chapter 14 Exercise 05 'Scala for the Impatient' by Horstmann C.S.
  *
  * One can use lists to model trees that store values only in the leaves.
  * For example, the list ((3 8) 2 (5)) describes the tree
  *     â€¢
  *    /|\
  *   â€¢ 2 â€¢
  *  / \  |
  * 3   8 5
  *
  * However, some of the list elements are numbers and others are lists. In Scala, you cannot have heterogeneous lists,
  * so you have to use a List[Any]. Write a leafSum function to compute the sum of all elements in the leaves,
  * using pattern matching to differentiate between numbers and lists.
