  * Created by Iryna Kharaborkina on 8/8/16. 
  *
  * Solution to the Chapter 11 Exercise 02 'Scala for the Impatient' by Horstmann C.S.
  *
  * The BigInt class has a pow method, not an operator. Why didnâ€™t the Scala library
  * designers choose ** (as in Fortran) or `^` (as in Pascal) for a power operator?
