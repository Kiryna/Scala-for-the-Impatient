4. Scala lets you multiply a string with a numberâ€”try out "crazy" * 3 in the REPL. What does this
operation do? Where can you find it in Scaladoc?

scala> "crazy" * 3
res0: String = crazycrazycrazy

The operation return a String that contains an initial String duplicated n times (whether n is an argument of * function)

The above can be found in Scaladoc: http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.collection.immutable.StringLike

def *(n: Int): String
    Return the current string concatenated n times.
