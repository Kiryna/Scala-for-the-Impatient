5. What does 10 max 2 mean? In which class is the max method defined?

The above returns the max from two values (in this particular case it is 10):

scala> 10 max 2
res1: Int = 10

This is the same as:

scala> 10.max(2)
res2: Int = 10

It is defined in: http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.runtime.RichInt

def max(that: Int): Int

    Returns this if this > that or that otherwise.
